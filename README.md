Tessellate
==========

Small vanilla JavaScript module for gracefully removing elements from the page.

Overview
----------

When you remove a floated element from the DOM, all the other elements simply occupy the now unallocated space immediately. However, with Tessellate, unallocated space due to removed nodes are occupied gracefully with CSS3 animations.
